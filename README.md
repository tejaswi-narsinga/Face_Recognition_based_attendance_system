# Face_Recognition_based_attendance_system
The "Face Recognition-Based Attendance System" project leverages face recognition technology to automate attendance tracking. By using a camera, the system captures and identifies students' faces, matching them with pre-registered profiles. If a match is found, the attendance is recorded in a log. The system uses Python, OpenCV for facial detection, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification. The application is designed to be user-friendly, displaying a list of users and an attendance sheet. Additionally, the system allows for model training, and attendance is stored in a CSV file for future reference.
